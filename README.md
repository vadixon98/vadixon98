-  Hi, I’m @vadixon98
-  I’m passionate about rock climbing, yoga, and reading, and I’m equally excited about applying my curiosity and discipline to the world of coding and bioinformatics.
-  Professionally, I have hands-on experience applying data-driven approaches to biological research, and I’m now pursuing opportunities that let me combine my background in biology and bioinformatics with computational problem-solving.
-  My goal is to contribute to projects that leverage bioinformatic tools and platforms for niche data exploration, analysis, and visualization, particularly in agricultural research and biotech environments.
-  If you’d like to connect, feel free to reach out to my personal email: ashleighdixon1998@gmail.com
