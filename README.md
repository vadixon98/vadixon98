-  Hi, I’m @vadixon98
-  I’m passionate about rock climbing, yoga, and reading, and I’m equally excited about applying my curiosity and discipline to the world of coding and bioinformatics.
- I have experience in data-driven biological research and seek to combine my biology and bioinformatics skills with computational problem-solving, focusing on bioinformatic tools for agricultural and biotech projects.
